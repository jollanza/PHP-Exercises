  For your second PHP exercise, echo the following statement to the browser:
    &ldquo;Twinkle, Twinkle little star.&rdquo;
  Next, create two variables, one for the word &ldquo;Twinkle&rdquo; and one for the word &ldquo;star&rdquo;.
  Echo the statement to the browser, this time substituting the variables for the relevant words.
  Change the value of each variable to whatever you like, and echo the statement a third time.
  Remember to include code to show your statements on different lines.
